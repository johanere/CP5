Project 5 in Computational Physics

Project5_JN.pdf contains the project report.
On the system of sub directories:
This repository contains my hand in for project 5 in the course Computational Physics at UiO. All code can be found in the code directory, 
which has two sub directories. One for the 1D case, and one for the 2D case. Each of which has a Data directiory, in which 
the output from the programs are deposited. Python programs located in the Data directories output plots and tabels
to the Results directory found in the main folder. Tex contains files used for compiling the project report.
