Project 5 in Computational Physics

This repository contains my hand in for project 5 in the course Computational Physics at UiO, the project report may 
be found in the main folder: Project5_JN.pdf

On the system of sub directories:
All code can be found in the code directory, 
which has two sub directories. One for the 1D case, and one for the 2D case. Each of which has a Data directiory, in which 
the output from the programs are deposited. Python programs located in the Data directories output plots and tabels
to the Results directory found in the main folder. Tex contains files used for compiling the project report.
